The HDFS structure
==================

Thetis expects a specific structure in the HDFS file system.

First of all, there are tenants. Each tenant has a directory of the form ``/group/TENANT``.

Raw data should go in ``/group/TENANT/raw``.

A tenant has many dataset. Each dataset is defined by a schema file located at ``/group/TENANT/metadata/schema/DATASET/schema.json``.

Various metadata (check, stats) are outputed to various subdirs of ``/group/TENANT/metadata/``.

The cleaned data are outputed to ``/group/TENANT/data/DATASET``.

All path, except the path to the schema itself, are configurable in the ``schema.json`` file.
