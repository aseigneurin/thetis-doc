Get started
===========

Thetis is a software that allows you to clean automatically you data. On top of that, Thetis can infer a schema on your
data, check if your data have been correctly cleaned and make some statistics on your features. Furthermore, reports are
created for each step of Thetis. You can access the report either by downloading a csv file or by requesting a Hive
table (with Hive or Impala).

For the moment Thetis is only usable through a Command Line Interface (CLI). Make sure that you are on a folder
containing the files ``thetis.jar`` and ``thetis.sh``. The ``thetis.sh`` file is made for not having to specify
technical configurations but only business ones. To run Thetise execute the following command :

``./thetis.sh <args>``


where ``<args>`` are some arguments detailed below.


Commands
--------

The following commands are available:

infer-schema
  Infer the schema from some input data. See bellow

check
  Check that some data is valid according to the schema, and output validation info in /group/TENANT/metadata/check/DATASET

clean
  Clean some data, reading it using a schema, and output cleaned data in /group/TENANT/data/DATASET

clean-parquet
  Same as clean, but output parquet files

stats
  Compute statistics on the data, to see what's in it in a glance. Result is placed in /group/TENANT/metadata/stats/DATASET

create
  Create a hive table for the cleaned data

refresh
  Reload all hive metadata for a tenant, so that new data files can be considered by hive

avro-schema
  Generate a avro schema for the dataset


Each command takes two arguments ``--tenant`` and ``--dataset`` (or ``-t`` and ``-d``) and does the right thing.
There may also be other ways to call the commands, for backward compatibility or finer-grained feature testing.

Usage
-----

You can see the up-to-date usage information for Thetis by running ``thetis.sh --help``::

    Usage: thetis [options] <command>...

      <command>...
            commands to run
    Possible commands: clean-parquet,stats,refresh-hive-metadata,clean,create-hive-table,check,avro-schema,infer-schema

      -t <value> | --tenant <value>
            name of the tenant (required)
      -d <value> | --dataset <value>
            name of the dataset (if not provided, process all datasets in the tenant)

    The following options are only useful for the 'infer-schema' command
      --input <value>
            uri of the file in hdfs (required for infer-schema)
      --delimiter <value>
            delimiter character (required for infer-schema)
      --charset <value>
            charset of the file in hdfs (utf-8 by default)

Usage example::

    ./thetis.sh --tenant some_tenant --dataset some_dataset clean  # Clean the given dataset


The ``--tenant`` option is required for all commands. ``--dataset`` is optional ; if it is not provided, all the dataset
in the tenant are processed with the given commands::

    ./thetis.sh --tenant some_tenant clean  # Clean all the datasets in the given tenant

More than one command can be provided, in that case, they are executed in sequence::

    ./thetis.sh --tenant some_tenant --dataset some_dataset clean stats  # Clean the dataset, then generate some stats

**Important to note** : stats are computed from cleaned data. So you need to execute a clean before a stats. For exemple,
the command::

    ./thetis.sh --tenant some_tenant --dataset some_dataset stats clean

won't work. You need to write clean before stats.
